                    Before meeting with Blaxbaum Consulting, I was applying to as many jobs as I could but with no responses - but once I sat down with one of their consultants for resume review and interview prep, I was able to land multiple interviews and job offers. The consultants are extremely friendly and highly experienced. I would, and have already, recommend Blaxmaum to any who is planning to apply to a job!  </p>
